# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple React-based Tic-Tac-Toe game application. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and achieve a winning combination.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on empty squares to make their moves.
- **Winning Detection**: The game detects and displays the winner or a draw.
- **Time Travel**: Players can review previous moves and jump to any point in the game.
- **Sorting Moves**: Players can sort moves in ascending or descending order.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Components

### `Square`

Represents an individual square on the game board. It displays the current value (X, O, or empty) and triggers a callback function when clicked.

### `Board`

Manages the game board state, including rendering squares, detecting wins, and handling player moves.

### `Game`

Top-level component that orchestrates the game flow, manages history, and controls the interface.
